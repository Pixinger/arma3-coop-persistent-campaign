<h1>Welcome to the TeamKommando</h1>

<h2>Requirements (don't be shy):</h2>
<p>
• Teamspeak 3 is required - we don't bite you.<br />
• TaskForceRadio is required.<br />
• We play tactically and coordinated - Lonewolfs will be kicked.<br />
<br />
You find us at <a href="http://www.teamkommando.net">www.teamkommando.net</a>.<br />
Our Teamspeak is at <b>voice.teamkommando.net:9987</b>.<br />

We are always looking for new members. If you like teamwork, then talk to us.<br />
As we are a german speaking clan, it might take a while to regroup to an english speaking squad. So please be patient, we will do our very best.<br />
